this is a work in progress.

I am rebuilding awfixer.com with all subdomains currently in use as subpaths, help, docs, and a few others that were seperate domains.

it is a bun project. we have nextjs installed though we are using it very minimally as to prevent vendor lockin.

we means me, myself, I, the voices in my head and claude code.

we use prisma, upstash, neon, postgres to manage our db.

we use better auth, currently it works in a limbo prisma managed integration with neon using neon auth which is built with better-auth.

depending on how I feel this website should be done by end of next week.

if you want to contribute then open a PR, I will get to it hopefully by the end of day and this will be handing off to another developer when I am done because I am really not supposed to be doing this.
